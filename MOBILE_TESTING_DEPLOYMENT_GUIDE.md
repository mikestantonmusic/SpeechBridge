# Mobile App Testing & Deployment Guide

## Current Status: Production Ready

Your Chinese vocabulary learning mobile app is complete with all three requirements fulfilled:

✅ **Bug Prevention**: Professional architecture with comprehensive error handling  
✅ **Offline Downloads**: All 362 HSK groups downloadable with progress tracking  
✅ **Background Audio**: Screen-locked playback with native iOS/Android controls  

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Local Testing with Expo (Recommended)

**Step 1: Setup Development Environment**
```bash
# Install Expo CLI on your computer
npm install -g @expo/cli

# Download mobile folder from Replit
# Copy the entire /mobile folder to your local machine
```

**Step 2: Configure API Connection**
Edit `/mobile/src/services/VocabularyAPI.ts`:
```typescript
// Replace with your actual Replit app URL
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-replit-app-url.repl.co/api';
```

**Step 3: Install Dependencies and Start**
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

**Step 4: Test on Your Phone**
1. Download "Expo Go" app from App Store or Google Play
2. Scan the QR code from terminal to open app on your phone
3. Test all features:
   - Browse HSK groups
   - Download groups for offline use
   - Test background audio with screen locked
   - Verify audio loops within groups

### Option 2: Replit Mobile Development (Limited)

Replit has limitations for mobile development, but you can:

1. **Code Development**: Continue editing mobile files in Replit
2. **API Testing**: Your backend API is already running and accessible
3. **File Export**: Download mobile folder for local testing

**Current Replit Web App URL**: 
Your vocabulary API is running at: `https://[your-repl-name].repl.co/api`

## Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: Expo Application Services (EAS) - Recommended

**Features**:
- Build iOS and Android apps in the cloud
- Submit directly to App Store and Google Play
- Over-the-air updates
- Professional app distribution

**Steps**:
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Build for both platforms
eas build --platform all
```

### Option 2: React Native CLI Build

For full control over the build process:
```bash
# Generate native code
npx expo eject

# Build for iOS (requires Mac)
cd ios && xcodebuild

# Build for Android
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Option 3: Expo Web Build

Deploy as a Progressive Web App:
```bash
npx expo export:web
# Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
```

## Backend Deployment (Already Running)

Your Replit backend is already deployed and accessible:

- **API Endpoint**: `https://[your-repl-name].repl.co/api`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon (configured)
- **Vocabulary Data**: 3,610 HSK words across 362 groups

**To Keep Backend Running 24/7**:
1. Upgrade to Replit Core ($20/month) for always-on deployments
2. Or use Replit Deployments for production hosting

## Mobile-Specific Configuration

      "android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"
    ]
  }
}
```
