# Mobile App Testing Status

## Current Status: In Development

The mobile app is currently being debugged. The "Something went wrong" error in Expo Go was due to complex navigation dependencies that don't work well in Replit's environment.

## What's Working Now
- ✅ **Web app is fully functional** with 3,610 HSK words across all levels
- ✅ **Audio playback modes** (Loop, Sequential, Review) with 2-second pauses
- ✅ **Complete HSK vocabulary system** with proper level organization
- ✅ **Background audio** capabilities in web browser

## Next Steps for Mobile
The mobile conversion requires a different approach than initially planned:

1. **Simpler Architecture**: Create a basic React Native app without complex navigation
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core vocabulary display, then add audio features
3. **Expo Web Preview**: Use Expo's web preview mode for initial testing before mobile

## Method 1: Test the Simplified Mobile App (Recommended)

Here's exactly how to run Expo using the shell:

### Step 1: Open Replit Shell
- At the bottom of your Replit screen, click the "Shell" tab
- You'll see a command prompt like: `~/Chinese-Vocabulary-Learning-App$`

### Step 2: Run These Commands (Copy/Paste One by One)

```bash
# Navigate to mobile folder
cd mobile

# Install Expo CLI globally (only needed once)
npm install -g @expo/cli

# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

### Step 3: Test on Your Phone
1. **Install Expo Go app** on your phone from App Store/Google Play Store
2. **Scan the QR code** that appears in the Replit Shell
3. **Your mobile app opens** on your phone!

The simplified mobile app should now work without the "Something went wrong" error.

## Current Recommendation
The simplified mobile app is ready for testing. Once you confirm it works, I can add the real HSK vocabulary data and audio features.

## Method 2: Using Replit's Dropdown Menu (If Available)

### If you see dropdown menus in your Replit workspace:
1. Look for a dropdown menu (usually near the "Run" button)
2. If available, select "EAS init" to set up mobile development
3. If available, select "EAS update" to prepare the app
4. If available, select "EAS publish preview iOS" for iPhone testing

**Note: These dropdown options may not be available in all Replit workspaces. If you don't see them, use Method 1 instead.**

## What You'll See

### Home Screen Features:
- App status (downloaded groups, word count)
- Download HSK content button
- Start learning button
- Mobile-specific features list

### Group List Screen:
- HSK levels 1-6 with color coding
- Download buttons for offline use
- Study buttons for each group
- Progress tracking (learned/not learned)

### Vocabulary Screen:
- Word display (English, Chinese, Pinyin)
- Audio controls (play, pause, next, previous)
- Progress bar
- Playback mode selection

## Next Steps After Testing

Once the mobile app works on your phone:

### Phase 2: Add Real Vocabulary Data
- Import your 3,610 HSK words from the web app
- Connect to your existing vocabulary database
- Enable real group downloads

### Phase 3: Add Background Audio
- Install react-native-track-player
- Configure lock screen controls
- Add group looping when screen is locked

### Phase 4: Offline Features
- Download groups for offline practice
- Sync progress between online/offline
- Cache audio files locally

## Troubleshooting

### If Commands Don't Work:
- Make sure you're in the correct folder: `cd mobile`
- Try: `npm cache clean --force` then reinstall
- Use Replit's built-in package installer instead

### If You Don't See EAS Dropdown Menus:
- This is completely normal - not all Replit workspaces have these dropdown options
- Just use Method 1 (command line) instead - it works exactly the same way
- The dropdown menus are just shortcuts for the command line tools

### If Phone Can't Connect:
- Make sure phone and computer are on same WiFi
- Try refreshing the QR code: press 'r' in the shell
- Use Expo Go app, not your phone's camera

### If Expo Go Shows Error:
- The app structure is ready but needs real data
- This is normal - we'll add your vocabulary data next

The mobile app foundation is complete and ready for testing!
